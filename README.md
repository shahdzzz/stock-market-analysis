# Stock Market Analysis Project

Welcome to the Stock Market Analysis project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of stock data for 19 different companies collected from various sources. The project utilizes daily and yearly stock measures and employs Power BI for data visualization. Additionally, an Oracle SQL database is utilized to build the data model and execute business queries. This README file will guide you through the project's structure, data sources, tools, and steps to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of stock data from 19 different companies. The analysis involves data collection, data processing, data modeling, creation of business queries, and data visualization to gain valuable insights into stock market trends.

## Data Sources

The stock data for the 19 companies is collected from various online sources, including financial websites and APIs. The data includes both daily and yearly stock measures such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume.

## Tools Used

- Power BI: Used for data visualization and interactive dashboards.
- Oracle SQL: Utilized to build the data model and perform complex business queries.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the raw stock data files collected from different sources.
- `scripts/`: Contains any data processing scripts used to clean and preprocess the data.
- `sql/`: Contains SQL scripts used for data modeling and business queries.
- `visualizations/`: Contains Power BI files for interactive data visualizations.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the analysis and visualizations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up an Oracle SQL database and execute the SQL scripts in the `sql/` folder to build the data model.
3. Use Power BI to open the Power BI files in the `visualizations/` folder for data visualization.

## Data Processing

Before building the data model, it's important to preprocess the raw data. Use the scripts in the `scripts/` folder to clean and transform the data into a suitable format for analysis.

## Data Modeling

The Oracle SQL scripts in the `sql/` folder provide instructions for creating the data model. Execute these scripts to design a structured database that can efficiently store and manage the stock data.

## Business Queries

The SQL scripts in the `sql/` folder also include predefined business queries that can provide insights into the stock market trends. Modify and execute these queries to obtain specific information from the data model.

## Data Visualization

The Power BI files in the `visualizations/` folder contain pre-designed interactive dashboards. Open these files using Power BI to visualize the stock market trends, explore data, and gain valuable insights from the visual representations.

## Conclusion

The Stock Market Analysis project offers a comprehensive approach to understanding stock market trends for 19 different companies. By combining data collection, processing, modeling, business queries, and visualization, this project provides a robust framework for making informed investment decisions.
